The information from Redis gets me the zkillid and hash.  I can then do the call in the get_items_dropped.sh and all the information I
used to get from redis is available there, so almost all the code could be transferred there.

This Python code can give me a sortable timestamp down to the microsecond which should be sufficent.

import datetime
import time

# Option 1: Preferred - Use datetime with microsecond precision (recommended)
now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC)  # or .now() for local time
sortable_timestamp = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S-%f")  # .%f gives microseconds

print(sortable_timestamp)
